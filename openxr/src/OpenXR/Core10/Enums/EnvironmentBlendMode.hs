-- | 'ENVIRONMENT_BLEND_MODE_OPAQUE'. The composition layers will be
-- displayed with no view of the physical world behind them. The composited
-- image will be interpreted as an RGB image, ignoring the composited alpha
-- channel. This is the typical mode for VR experiences, although this mode
-- can also be supported on devices that support video passthrough.

-- | 'ENVIRONMENT_BLEND_MODE_ADDITIVE'. The composition layers will be
-- additively blended with the real world behind the display. The
-- composited image will be interpreted as an RGB image, ignoring the
-- composited alpha channel during the additive blending. This will cause
-- black composited pixels to appear transparent. This is the typical mode
-- for an AR experience on a see-through headset with an additive display,
-- although this mode can also be supported on devices that support video
-- passthrough.
pattern ENVIRONMENT_BLEND_MODE_ADDITIVE = EnvironmentBlendMode 2

-- | 'ENVIRONMENT_BLEND_MODE_ALPHA_BLEND'. The composition layers will be
-- alpha-blended with the real world behind the display. The composited
-- image will be interpreted as an RGBA image, with the composited alpha
-- channel determining each pixelâ€™s level of blending with the real world
-- behind the display. This is the typical mode for an AR experience on a
-- phone or headset that supports video passthrough.
